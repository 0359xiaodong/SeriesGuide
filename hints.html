<h2>Overview video</h2>
<p>This was made on Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), so it might look a little different on your device.</p>

<h2>Updating your shows</h2>
There are three options to update your shows:<br/>
<br/>
<dl>
	<dt>Update a single show</dt>
	<dd>Long-press a show and select <em>Update</em>. This will get the latest data of this show from TheTVDB.</dd>
	<dt>Update shows marked as updated by TheTVDB</dt>
	<dd>Press the update icon (double arrows) in the action bar (top right). This will ask TheTVDB for any shows that were updated since the last time you updated via this button or did update all shows.</dd>
	<dt>Update all shows</dt>
	<dd>Press the menu button on your device and select <em>Update all</em>. This will get the latest data for all shows, regardless if they got updated or not.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Backing up your show database</h2>
To backup your show database go into <strong>Settings</strong>, look for <strong>Backup/Restore</strong>. There you can make a new backup file of your show database on your devices external storage (like an SD card).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><em>Hint:</em> If you enable <strong>Integrate with trakt.tv</strong> and mark an episode watched in a shows overview screen, it gets marked on your trakt.tv account. If you want to access your shows on another device you just have to setup your trakt.tv account again and look for your shows in <strong>Add Show</strong>. After you added them you can sync the episodes watched state from trakt.tv to your device via the <strong>Sync with trakt.tv</strong> setting. However this is still experimental (you can see that by how many manual steps it takes to do this) so your milage may vary.</blockquote>
