        <h2>trakt.tv integration</h2>
        <p>The following sections assume that you have <strong>connected your trakt account</strong> within SeriesGuide.<br/>Look in <strong>Settings</strong> under <strong>trakt.tv</strong> if you want to.</p>

        <br/>

        <h3>Adding shows</h3>
        <p>Press the + button and then swipe to the <strong>Library</strong> tab. SeriesGuide will try to load which episodes are already watched from trakt.</p>

        <br/>
        
        <h3>What is synced?</h3>
        <div class="row">

                <dl>
                	<dt>Check Ins</dt>

        <h3>Bulk syncing</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you might be in need of syncing a bulk of watched flags, such as <strong>a whole season</strong> you just marked watched or to <strong>match up unseen episodes</strong> with your trakt library.</p>
        <p>Go into SeriesGuide <strong>Settings</strong>. Go to the <strong>trakt.tv</strong> section and look for <strong>Sync with trakt.tv</strong>. If you want to match up unseen episodes, check the box on the bottom.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        
        <h2>Backup or restore your show database</h2>
        <p>To backup or restore your show database go into <strong>Settings</strong> and look for <strong>Backup/Restore</strong>. There you will find instructions on how to proceed.</p>
        
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2>Keep your shows up to date</h2>
        <p><strong>You don't have to!</strong> If you make sure <strong>Auto Update</strong> is enabled in <strong>Settings</strong>, SeriesGuide updates every show every 7 days. However there are three options to manually update your shows:</p>
        <br/>
        <dl>
	        <dt>Update outdated shows</dt>
	        <dd>Press the update icon (double arrows). This will update all shows which have not been updated for 7 or more days. Enabling <strong>Auto Update</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> does the same thing on opening the show list.</dd>
	        <br/>
	        <dt>Update a single show</dt>
	        <dd>Sometimes you may want to get the latest info for just one show. To do this long-press on a show in the show list and select <em>Update</em>.</dd>
	        <br/>
	        <dt>Update all shows</dt>
	        <dd>To get fresh data for every show, regardless when it has been updated last, press the menu button on your device and select <em>Update (all)</em>.</dd>
