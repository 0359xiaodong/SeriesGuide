	        <dd>Sometimes you may want to get the latest info for just one show. To do this long-press on a show in the show list and select <em>Update</em>.</dd>
	        <br/>
	        <dt>Update all shows</dt>
	        <dd>To get fresh data for every show, regardless when it has been updated last press the menu button on your device and select <em>Update (all)</em>.</dd>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2>Backing up your show database</h2>
        <p>To backup your show database go into <strong>Settings</strong> and look for <strong>Backup/Restore</strong>. There you will find instructions on how to proceed.</p>
        <br/>
        <blockquote><em>Always have a 'backup' with trakt integration:</em> Enable <strong>Integrate with trakt.tv</strong> in Settings. If you then mark an episode seen in a shows overview screen, it gets marked on trakt.tv, too. Now, to access your shows on another device just setup your trakt.tv account in Settings again and look for your shows in <strong>Add Show</strong>. After you added them you can sync the watched states from trakt.tv to your device via the <strong>Sync with trakt.tv</strong> setting. However this is still experimental so your milage may vary.</blockquote>
