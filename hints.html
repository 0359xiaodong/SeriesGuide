        <h2>How do check ins work</h2>
        <p>Depending on which service you use, check ins behave a little differently.</p>
        <dt><p>trakt</p></dt>
        <dd><p>Checks into <strong>single episodes</strong>, so look out which episode is displayed when you check in.</p></dd>
        <dt><p>GetGlue</p></dt>
        <dd><p>Checks into a <strong>show</strong>. You can use the <em>Paste episode</em> button to include the watched episode title in your check in comment.</p></dd>
        
        <div class="spacer"></div> 
        
        <h2>Set up trakt.tv sync</h2>
        <p>To quickly get started with trakt, follow these three steps:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><p>Look in <strong>Settings</strong> for <strong>trakt.tv</strong> to connect or create your <a href="http://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a> account.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use the <strong>Sync to trakt.tv</strong> button to upload your existing shows to trakt.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add shows on other devices by swiping to the <strong>Library</strong> tab when adding shows.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <br/>        
        
        <p>Now whenever SeriesGuide updates, your trakt activity is downloaded to all of your devices. This includes flagging episodes watched or collected and check ins with trakt.</p>
        
        <div class="spacer"></div>  
        
        <h2>Check in, flag watched and collected</h2>
 
        <p>Each episode displays a button bar with four actions:</p>
        <div class="row">
        
            <div class="span3">
            	<img src="images/episode-bar.png" alt="Episode action bar" >
        	</div>
        
            <div class="span3">
                <ul>
                    <li><p><i>Check in</i> (via GetGlue or trakt)</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Watched</i> flag toggle</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Collected</i> flag toggle</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Create calendar event</i></p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>  
        	
    	</div> <!-- row -->
        
        <div class="spacer"></div>       
        
        <h2>Backup or restore your show database</h2>
        <p>To backup or restore your show database go into <strong>Settings</strong> and look for <strong>Backup/Restore</strong>. There you will find instructions on how to proceed.</p>
        <p><span class="label label-info">Tip</span> Some users sync their backup file with e.g. Dropbox around devices as an alternative to a trakt account.</p>
        
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2>Keep your shows up to date</h2>
        <p><strong>You don't have to!</strong> If you make sure <strong>Auto Update</strong> is enabled in <strong>Settings</strong>, SeriesGuide updates every show at least every 7 days. However there are three options to manually update your shows:</p>
        <br/>
        <dl>
	        <dt>Update outdated shows</dt>
	        <dd>Press the update icon (double arrows). This will update all shows which have not been updated for 7 or more days. Enabling <strong>Auto Update</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> does the same thing on opening the show list.</dd>
	        <br/>
	        <dt>Update a single show</dt>
	        <dd>Sometimes you may want to get the latest info for just one show. To do this long-press on a show in the show list and select <em>Update</em>.</dd>
	        <br/>
	        <dt>Update all shows</dt>
	        <dd>To get fresh data for every show, regardless when it has been updated last, press the menu button on your device and select <em>Update (all)</em>.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Adding shows</h3>
        <p>Press the + button and then swipe to the <strong>Library</strong> tab.</p>
        <p><span class="label label-info">Info</span> SeriesGuide will try to load which episodes are already watched and collected from trakt when adding a show.</p>

        <h3>Bulk syncing</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you might be in need of syncing a bulk of watched flags, such as <strong>a whole season</strong> you just marked watched or to <strong>match up unwatched episodes</strong> with your trakt library.</p>
        <p>Go into SeriesGuide <strong>Settings</strong>. Go to the <strong>trakt.tv</strong> section and look for <strong>Sync with trakt.tv</strong>. If you want to match up unwatched episodes, check the box on the bottom.</p>
