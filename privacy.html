        <h2>Third-party tracking</h2>
        <p>SeriesGuide uses Google Analytics for Mobile which may collect information about <b>your device</b>, <b>log information</b> (e.g. crash logs which might include show identifiers, check in messages and other information you entered) and <b>used features</b> and <b>screens</b>. SeriesGuide enables the 'Anonymize IP' flag which tells Google Analytics to anonymize the information sent by the tracker objects by <b>removing the last octet of the IP address</b> prior to its storage.</p>
        <p>This data is used to maintain and improve SeriesGuide for our users and help with the development of new features.</p>
