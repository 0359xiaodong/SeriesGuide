        <p>SeriesGuide is developed as open source, non-paid. If you really like it, paying for it is a nice gesture showing your support. However you can also help by <a href="https://plus.google.com/112462818579768957964">sending in feedback</a>, <a href="http://crowdin.net/project/seriesguide-translations/invite">translating on crowdin</a> or even <a href="https://github.com/UweTrottmann/SeriesGuide/">forking the code</a> and adding features.</p>
        
        <h2>Get notifications</h2>

        <h2>More list widget options</h2>
        <p>In addition to upcoming episodes, you can have a list widget (Android 3.0 and above) display recent episodes and change its transparency.</p>
        
        <h2>SeriesGuide X users ride for free!</h2>
